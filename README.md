Run4Life-Dos-Game
=================
It is a old code, I developed it in my school days. Simple dos based game, build over C Graphics Liberary. Screehshot is also attached.
Whole game is splitted over multiple executables as 16 bit turbo c compiler was not able to compile the whole code so it transfer game state
from one state to another.
